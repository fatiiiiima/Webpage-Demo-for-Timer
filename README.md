# Webpage-Demo-for-Timer
This is a demo I made using HTML, CSS, and JS for the company WiseAPP based in Dubai. The code is just a simple demo and a basic implementation. With more TIME and RESOURCES, it can be worked on the backend part as well. 

The first webpage allows the user to select a time from a dropdown list. After choosing the time, the user is redirected to the second webpage where they can choose from six different departments. Each department has a specific NFC number tied to it. After choosing the department, the user is redirected to the third webpage where the NFC number of the specific department is displayed along with a timer at the bottom that counts backwards from the time that the user chose on the first webpage. After the timer reaches 00:00, the user is then redirected to the first webpage. 

Feel free to USE THIS CODE!

Please check the master branch for the code.
